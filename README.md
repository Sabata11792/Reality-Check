App made to help preform reality checks for those who practice lucid dreaming.

This app displays random numbers in hope that you will successfully preform a reality check while dreaming.

When dreaming the theory is that you will pull out you phone and associate you device or this app with the thought of "I am in a dream".

Lucid dreaming is PURELY SUBJECTIVE and there are no guarantees.

Shows time and date.
Shows both persistent and changing numbers.
Two customizable messages/reminders.
Option to show incorrect numbers forcing you to pay more attention.
